# Insurance Charges Prediction

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using machine learning regression models.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze medical insurance data and build a predictive model for insurance charges based on demographic and behavioral features such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region.

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Training and evaluation of regression models  
- Model comparison using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Outcome
The final model provides a reliable estimation of insurance charges and demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in a real-world insurance-related problem.
